# Brela Exams Backend

## The Plan:
### In this app, you enter a prompt for specific exam that you want ( for example: beginner Spanish, or countires of the world ). That prompt hits the chatGPT API, returns your exam with 10 to 20 questions and answers. Then you can take that exam or print it out.

This backend was built beginning with this template: <a href="https://github.com/OmiSoftNet/omisoft-blog-template-back?tab=readme-ov-file" target="_blank">omnisoft-blog-template-back</a>
